Suggest zero-knowledge or discuss

Sections 3.4 and 4. Replace that commitment scheme with the one implemented, to try and reduce proof size and prover time simultaneously.
Will ask if implementation is public yet. Maybe it is in Rust!

Point 1:
simple zero-knowledge encoding method?

Point 2:
soundness error needs to be improved. underlying code needs better distance. even if we use DI, better to use an underlying code with good distance.
So extend brakedown table to get better distance and investigate.
Work out theoretical limit to distance of Brakedown, based on constraints to input of entropy function.
