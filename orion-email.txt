Counter example:

We use a toy linear code that maps from F^2 to F^3.
Its generator matrix looks like this:
1 1 0
0 0 1
which means for message [a b], the corresponding codeword will be [a a b]. 
The first element and the second element in the codeword is identical to the first element in the message.

In orion's protocol
suppose C_2_m is the mask matrix, it looks like this:
a1 a2 a3
a4 a5 a6
a7 a8 a9
we choose the index set I_1 = {2} and I_1_hat = {1}

And C_2_m_w is the masked matrix, it looks like this:
b1 b2 b3
b4 b5 b6
b7 b8 b9
we choose the index set I_0 = {1} and I_0_hat = {2}

Note that I_0 ^ I_1 = emptyset and  I_0_hat ^  I_1_hat = emptyset. The restriction is satisfied.

And the coefficient matrix looks like this:
w1 w2 w3
w4 w5 w6
w7 w8 w9

Then when we execute the protocol, we will query and learn a4 and b2. 
Since [a2 a5 a8] is a valid codeword, then a2 = a5
Since [a4 a5 a6] is a valid codeword, then a4 = a5
Then we can reveal w2 and break zero-knowledge as follows:
w2 = b2 - a2 = b2 - a5 = b2 - a4
