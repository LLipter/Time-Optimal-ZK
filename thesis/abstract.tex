% An interactive argument (or computationally sound proof system) is a relaxation of an interactive proof, introduced in \cite{10.1145/22145.22178}. The difference is that the prover is restricted to be a polynomial-time algorithm for an interactive argument, whereas no such restrictions on the prover apply for an interactive proof. In this thesis, we focus on the practical usage of \textbf{linear time} interactive argument with or without zero-knowledge property. Additionally, many interactive argument systems use polynomial commitment as a fundamental building block. And polynomial commitment can imply a general interactive argument system. Hence, we will investigate the linear time polynomial commitment instead.

% Zero-knowledge proofs allow an untrusted prover to convince a sceptical verifier that a statement is true without revealing any further information about why the statement is true. Example use-cases include verifiable computing, where a powerful, but untrusted server proves, to a computationally weak client, that they performed a large calculation correctly. After years of research improving the proof size and verifier run-time of zero-knowledge proofs, prover runtime remains a major bottleneck.

% A line of work \cite{brakedown} \cite{cryptoeprint:2020/1426} \cite{BCL22} attempts to address this with zero-knowledge protocols where prover runtime is a constant multiplied by the time taken to perform the calculation. The only one of these works which investigates the practical efficiency of their constructions is \cite{brakedown}, which makes stronger security assumptions than the other works to achieve zero-knowledge and good verifier runtime. On the other hand, \cite{cryptoeprint:2020/1426} \cite{BCL22} rely on specialised constructions of error correcting codes, hash functions, and sub-protocols whose practical performance is unknown.

% The protocols in these works rely on special families of linear-time error-correcting codes, whose properties influence the final performance of the proof systems. Firstly, \cite{brakedown} \cite{cryptoeprint:2020/1426} \cite{BCL22} rely on codes with a tensor structure. The lower the dimension of the tensors, the smaller the proof size and verification time of the zero-knowledge proofs. The implementation of \cite{brakedown} uses low dimension. The first goal of this project is to extend the implementation of \cite{brakedown} to higher dimension and investigate the impact of dimension on performance, at various different security levels.

% Secondly, while \cite{brakedown} rely on strong assumptions in order to achieve zero-knowledge, \cite{cryptoeprint:2020/1426} \cite{BCL22} use codes with extra zero-knowledge properties. Codes with zero-knowledge properties are easy to obtain from plain codes via simple transformations that is similar to one-time-pad encryption, and codes with stronger zero-knowledge properties use more complex transformations, as described in \cite{10.1145/2554797.2554815}. The second goal of this project is to investigate the performance impact of adding zero-knowledge to the \cite{brakedown} polynomial commitment scheme using zero-knowledge codes, using the plain codes implemented by \cite{brakedown} as a starting point, and assess which transformations are more practical.

Interactive zero-knowledge proofs allow an untrusted prover to convince a skeptical verifier that a statement is true without revealing any
further information about why the statement is true. The polynomial commitment scheme is the key component of many proof systems, which
allows the prover to commit to a polynomial, and later reveal the evaluation of the polynomial at a given point, while allowing the verifier can
check that the evaluation is correct. After years of research, many
schemes with linear prover time have been proposed, however, there is
little work on their concrete efficiency and performance.

In this thesis, we want to investigate the concrete efficiency of those
polynomial commitment schemes, especially in high-dimensional situations. We implement the protocol in Rust, benchmark the performance and analyze the result. Additionally, we would investigate various ways to add zero-knowledge property into the polynomial commitment scheme and research their advantages and limitations.

We conclude that the efficiency and the soundness error of high dimensional polynomial commitment schemes are not acceptable to be
used in practice because of the lack of linear code that is both efficient in encoding and provides a large relative distance guarantee. And
we can add zero-knowledge property into the polynomial commitment
schemes at the cost of increasing prover time, verifier time, and proof
size by roughly a factor of two.
