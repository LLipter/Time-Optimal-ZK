An interactive argument (or computationally sound proof system) is a relaxation of an interactive proof, introduced in \cite{10.1145/22145.22178}. The difference is that the prover is restricted to be a polynomial-time algorithm for an interactive argument, whereas no such restrictions on the prover apply for an interactive proof. In this thesis, we focus on the practical usage of \textbf{linear time} interactive argument with or without zero-knowledge property. Additionally, many interactive argument systems use polynomial commitment as a fundamental building block. And polynomial commitment can also be considered as a special case of general interactive argument system. Hence, we first investigate the linear time polynomial commitment.
